# MB-Portfolio Readme

## Purpose

This Repository is being used to develop and display the portfolio of Marquez Brown.
Since he is currently enrolled in bootcamp, this is temporary and is being use to showcase coding practices.  Some challenges that were found were in learning how to customize bootstrap components, sizing and placement of elements as well as making sure the links were functional.
